Responsive Grid System - RGS
===

This grid system was based on the [Twitter Bootstrap 3 - Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), HOWEVER, it is not "mobile first" to ensure support for older browsers that do not support CSS Media Queries AND is flexibly is based on 10 and 12 columns, depending on the measures you choose your layout.

##Example using 10 colums based
```
<div class="row-10">
  <div class="col-md-3-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-3-3"></div>
  <div class="col-md-3-3"></div>
</div>
```
Note that three columns with `col-md-3-3` represents 33.3% each.
